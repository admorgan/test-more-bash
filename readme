# NAME

test-more-bash - Full Functionality TAP Test Framework for Bash

# SYNOPSIS

Write a test file like this. Maybe call it `test/test.t`.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash -e

    source test/more.bash

    plan tests 10

    some-command
    ok $? 'some-command is ok'

    # or:
    ok "`some-command`" 'some-command is ok'

    pass 'This will always pass'

    fail 'This will always fail'

    is `echo foo` 'foo' 'foo is foo'

    isnt foo bar "foo isn't bar"

    like food foo 'food is like foo'

    unlike team I "There's no 'I' in 'team'"

    diag "A message for stderr"

    note "A message for stdout"

Run the test with `prove` like this:

    prove test/test.t

Prove knows it's Bash from the first line, and it just works.

# DESCRIPTION

Test::More is the tried and true testing library for Perl. It uses TAP (the
Test Anything Protocol). This is the same thing for Bash.  For the most part it
should work exactly the same.

# METHODS

This is the basic usage:

* `plan tests $count`
* `ok $status_code "$label"`
* `pass "$label"`
* `fail "$label"`
* `is "$got" "$want" "label"`
* `isnt "$got" "$unwanted" "$label"`
* `like "$got" "$regex" "$label"`
* `unlike "$got" "$regex" "$label"`
* `diag "$message"`
* `note "$message"`
* `done_testing $count`
* `BAIL_OUT "$reason"`
* `plan skip_all "$reason"`

More detailed info coming soon.
